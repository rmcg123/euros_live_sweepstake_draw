## AUTOMATED EUROS LIVE DRAW 

This repository contains function to carry out a sweepstake draw for EURO 2024 and to live message the draw into a
WhatsApp group. This project used python 3.10 and the project requirements are listed in the requirements file. I
kept the draw entrants names and the id of the whatsapp group to send the messages to in a local .env file. If you wish
to reproduce this the id of the WhatsApp group can be got as the character string after the last "/" in the group join link
(An admin of the group your looking to message can share this link with you).
